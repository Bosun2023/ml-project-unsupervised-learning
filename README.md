# machine_learning_project-unsupervised-learning

## Project Overview

This project applies unsupervised learning techniques to analyze the "Wholesale Customer Data". The goal is to uncover customer purchasing patterns, segment customers into distinct groups, and offer actionable recommendations. 

## Project Workflow

Part I: EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis & Pre-processing

1. Data Import and Exploration
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Part II: KMeans Clustering

1. K-Means Clustering
2. Determine the Optimal Number of Clusters

Part III: Hierarchical Clustering

1. Hierarchical Clustering
2. Plot Dendrogram

Part IV: PCA - Principal Component Analysis

1. Dimensionality Reduction Using PCA

Part V: Conclusion

1. Results and Insights
2. Future Enhancements

## Dataset

The dataset includes information on customer channels, regions, and spending across product categories: Fresh, Milk, Grocery, Frozen, Detergents_Paper, and Delicassen.

## Key Outcomes

1. Customer Segmentation: Utilizing K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering, the analysis identifies distinct customer segments.

2. Feature Insights: PCA reveals critical features influencing customer spending behaviors.

3. Dimensionality Reduction: The first three principal components explain 84.79% of total variance.

4. Business Guidance: The analysis empowers businesses to tailor marketing and inventory strategies based on data-driven insights.
